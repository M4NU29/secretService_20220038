    <string name="message">“Cybersecurity is not just about defending against attacks; it’s about building resilience. It’s about understanding that breaches will happen and having a plan in place to minimize damage, recover quickly, and learn from the experience. The goal is to create a system that can absorb and adapt to attacks rather than one that merely reacts to them.”</string>
